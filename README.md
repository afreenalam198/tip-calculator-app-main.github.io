## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Using addEventListeners in scrip instead of onclick or oninput functions in html.

```js
billInput.addEventListener('input', () => {});
```

Using the forEach() function to loop through a group of buttons.

```js
tipBtns.forEach(btn => {});
```

### Continued development

In my future projects I would like to continue to work with more complex Javascript functionalities allowing me to improve my Javascript skills.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - This website worked as a good refresher and helped me with figuring out certain Javascript functionalities when I got stuck.
